# QuickDial
An application to generate QR code with mobile phone number. Scanning the QR code will launch the call app in phone and input the number. The application is designed to solve the car parking issue in Bangladesh. People go to work after parking and leave the phone number in/on the glass. Typing that number is not a good user experience.
